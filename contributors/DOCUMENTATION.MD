## Documentation

Chunk49 is a platform that accepts large Json and CSV files and splits them into smaller bits while 
maintaining the output value in same format.

**Technological Concept:**

With an easy-to- navigate design, Chunk49 is created to accept your CSV and Json files and returning 
same-format output, however large they may be, while also affording you the opportunity to either save 
for later or download on the spot.

**Note:** We do not store your files on our servers, they are automatically deleted after a period of time.

**Landing page Navigation:**
    
At the top-right bar of the landing page, you'll find the signup and login button which you can use to 
either signup or login from. Or, you can make use of the "get started" button which automatically takes 
you to the sign-up page. Need information on the product? Then easily get it from this page.
